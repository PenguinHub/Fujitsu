About 1 year ago, myself and 2 others made a simplified 2D version of dungeons and dragons in C++. 
None of us had ever used C++ let alone MFC, what we used for the GUI, 
but we all agreed that the best way to learn a language is by actually working on a project.
We both learned, and used several design patterns including: observer and factory, for efficiency as well as flexibility. 
This project was a great way to learn C++, and the difference between it and Java, the only other language we had previously used.
The result was a functional, although not visually appealing, turn based  game
where the players were able to make their own custom maps where they could choose what obstacles, treasure chests and monsters could be added to it.
Users were also able to make their own characters, attack and be attacked by monsters, level up, and move on to the next level.
